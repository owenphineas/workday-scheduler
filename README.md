# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Description
This is an online scheduling page. The site displays the current date and consists of a series of textboxes for each hour of the day, ranging from 6am to 9pm. The box for the current hour is highlighted in red, while past hours are gray and future hours are green. Users can enter scheduled events into the textboxes, and by clicking on the save button next to the textbox, the text will be saved to local storage. Upon loading the page, the items will display in their boxes. The webpage utilizes the dayjs API to display the current time and highlight the boxes appropriately, and the script utilizes the jQuery API for DOM traversal.

## Usage
The intended use of the webpage is to act as a way for users to schedule their days, by entering items into their schedule and referring back throughout the day. The webpage can be accessed at https://owenphineas.github.io/workday-scheduler/.
